Dataset - Total Business Sales & Total Business Inventory (US Feral Govt)

Modeled and forecasted a target series (total business sales) with a covariate (total business inventory). Implemented empirical data analysis by performing correlation (Pearson), decomposition, ADF test, and Cointegration by Johansen test. Modeled the datasets using  RegARIMA, TSLM, and VAR models. Compared these models using the Box-Ljung test and cross-validation to find the more accurate model. Derived the practical implementations of this project and created a Quarto presentation. Deployed the quarto presentation on Git Hub.
